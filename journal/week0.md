AWS architected framework Summary
The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of best practises for designing and operating cloud-based systems that  should be reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective.
The  AWS Well-Architected framework is divided into six pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization. The AWS framework  pillars provides a consistent approach to architecture evaluation and guidance to assist customers and partners in building and deploying reliable, efficient, and secure systems on AWS.

1.Operational Excellence Pillar focuses on how to run and monitor systems, and continually improving processes and procedures through automation,incident management by responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations through performance monitoring.

2.Security Pillar focuses on protecting information and systems using identity and access management, data protection, and incident management technologies.

3.Reliability Pillar ensures that systems operate continuously and are highly available through backup and recovery, fault tolerance, and scaling.

4.Performance Efficiency pillar focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes by selecting the right resource types and sizes, and optimizing the utilization of resources.

5.Cost Optimization pillar focuses on how to avoid unnecessary costs and to use cloud resources efficiently through cost-effective resource selection, resource utilization, and avoiding unneeded costs

6.Sustainability Pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key areas include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.
